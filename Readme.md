# Ludum Dare 54

Theme: Limited Space

## We Can Haul It

Goal: Transport the supplied needed to build a tower.

You have limited space on your single truck. Fortunately, you're a competent driver. Single-handedly deliver all the supplies needed to build the newest sky-scraper in town.

Mechanics:
* Drive your truck to various depots to pick up supplies
* Deliver them to the tower so that construction can progress
* Switch out your truck type to pick up a different type of supply
* You start out with only one trailer
* You can add additional trailers later
* Add lumber, cement, and sand/dirt to build the tower
* When tower requirements are met, it raises to the next level and has new requirements
* Each level of the tower unlocks upgrades to the modules for your truck

Key features:
* Can drive
* Can pick up supply
* Can deposit supply
* Can switch out module
* Can complete tower level
* Additional trailers?
