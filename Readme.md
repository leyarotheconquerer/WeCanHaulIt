# Ludum Dare 54

Theme: Limited Space

## Brainstorming

Mechanic: you limit space

Game plays out in front of you and you impact it by limiting the available space

Mechanic: space is limited

You must collect things to expand the available space so you can explore the place

Mechanic: You can only press space so many times

You must navigate a level but only jump so many times
You must type out a story but may only press space so many times

You're in space but space is a limited resource

Dungeon puzzler


Dump truck game
You must move things around and collect the ultimate thing
But you don't have enough space
Go around and collect lesser things to unlock more space
Then eventually you get the ultimate thing

Dungeon crawler with an inventory mechanic
But you can only pick up one thing at a time
So you can have a weapon, but no armor
Or armor but no weapon
Or a shield but no armor or a weapon
Or a bag, but nothing else

Elevator
Can only go to so many floors
You need to unlock more floors
Point and click game?
Puzzle game?
Carry the right people to the right floors?
Steal the right items from people as they travel in the elevator.

Trap whatever comes to pass
You only have limited space to move around
Set up traps to catch the best prey you possibly can
The better prey you trap, the better traps you set
Let the virtuous cycle continue until you are a trapping master!

Variant: dungeon master
Build a dungeon room, making it hard for enemies to get in
Tower defense essentially
But you only have one room. 
So you have to tear down your tower to build a better one

Mining/gardening game

You have a limited space mine
So be sure to put things into it to grow
Then harvest them again and plant again

Platformer
Movement modules are swappable
You can only have one
* Basic walking
* Jumping
* Repulsor
* Grapple
* Sliding?



## Ideas

**Space Trucker**

Welcome to the space trucking business. We used to have a Hyper-Galactic Haul-o-Matic Deluxe for you, but thanks to Jerry all we've got is this single module Plinker.

Here's a container module to start you out. Good luck!

Travel between various space stations, delivering goods using your module. Exchange your module to satisfy the various needs from each station.

Features:
* Moving your ship around
* Exchanging your module for another
	- Container module - holds small cargo
	- Gas module - sucks up nebula gas
	- Asteroid tractor - pulls astroids along behind you
	- Large container module - holds large cargo
* Deliver to stations
	- Gives you money
	- Allows you to buy new modules
	- Stations have a desire
	- Stations can supply

Options:
* Could be reskinned as a construction game
	- Container truck - components
	- Dump truck - dirt
	- Cement truck - cement
	- Logging truck - logs

Pros:
* No strong ai
* Simple movement
* Extensible

## We Can Haul It

Goal: Transport the supplied needed to build a tower.

You have limited space on your single truck. Fortunately, you're a competent driver. Single-handedly deliver all the supplies needed to build the newest sky-scraper in town.

Mechanics:
* Drive your truck to various depots to pick up supplies
* Deliver them to the tower so that construction can progress
* Switch out your truck type to pick up a different type of supply
* You start out with only one trailer
* You can add additional trailers later
* Add lumber, cement, and sand/dirt to build the tower
* When tower requirements are met, it raises to the next level and has new requirements
* Each level of the tower unlocks upgrades to the modules for your truck

Key features:
* Can drive
* Can pick up supply
* Can deposit supply
* Can switch out module
* Can complete tower level
* Additional trailers?
